center_xy_position:175,175      # Center of bed for example
endstop_xy_position:233.5,358   # Physical endstop nozzle over pin
speed: 100                      # X/Y travel speed between the two points
z_hop: 10                       # Lift nozzle to this value after probing and for move
z_hop_speed: 20                 # Hop speed of probe
ignore_alignment: False         # Optional - this allows ignoring the presence of z-tilt or quad gantry leveling config section
offset_min: -1                  # Optional - by default -1 is used - used as failsave to raise an error if offset is lower than this value
offset_max: 1                   # Optional - by default 1 is used - used as failsave to raise an error if offset is higher than this value
endstop_min: 0                  # Optional - by default disabled (0) - used as failsave to raise an error if endstop is lower than this value
endstop_max: 0                  # Optional - by default disabled (0) - used as failsave to raise an error if endstop is higher than this value

                                  1) If you need to lower the nozzle from -0.71 to -0.92 for example your value is -0.21.
                                  2) If you need to move more away from bed add a positive value.
